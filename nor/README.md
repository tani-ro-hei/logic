# nor.scm

This Scheme (Racket) program demonstrates that truth function logical NOR is functionally complete, namely, that any binary truth function f: {0,1} x {0,1} -> {0,1} is given by a composition just of NOR.

## Description

The higher-order function `truth-func`, constructed with only NOR, take six arguments `(map-11 map-10 map-01 map-00 x y)`, where function `map-xy` is composed just of NOR and `x`, `y` are truth values, and return the binary truth function which value on arguments (x, y) is equal to `(map-xy x y)`. So, if `func-imply` is defined as below:

```
(define func-imply
  (lambda (x y)
    (truth-func
      map-11-1
      map-10-0
      map-01-1
      map-00-1
    x y)
  )
)
```

where `map-xy-z` maps truth values (x, y) to z, then `func-imply` turns out logical IMP(â‡’) itself. In fact,

```
(func-imply #t #t)
(func-imply #t #f)
(func-imply #f #t)
(func-imply #f #f)
```

outputs

```
#t
#f
#t
#t
```
